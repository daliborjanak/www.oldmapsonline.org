#Add collections of maps

*Adding whole collection raises a number of visitors on your website. Only collections that meet these requirements can be uploaded:*

**1. High resolution scans of old maps (300 DPI, or at least 2 Mpix)**

**2. Maps in a zoomable viewer, available online without payments or passwords**

**3. Each map has its own permanent URL, taking users directly to the viewer**

**4. Coordinates for the corners of each map**

To upload your maps to OldMapsOnline, we need to receive:


##Spreadsheet with the list of maps

To add a map collection we need a excel spreadsheet with basic information about each map.

<a href="#">DOWNLOAD A SAMPLE</a>

Each spreadsheet must have following columns:

**id:** Your unique identifier<br>
**viewer:** URL to the zoomable viewer of the scan on the web <br>
**title:** Title of the map<br>
**date_from, date_to:** Date of what is depicted on the map, not the publishing date;<br>
if you know the exact date, then in either YYYY, YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD format<br>
if you know only the century, then as YYXX; eg. 16XX for the 1600-1699<br>
**north:** Latitude of the north-most point<br>
**south:** Latitude of the south-most point<br>
**east:** Longitude of the east-most point<br>
**west:** Longitude of the west-most point<br>

Use <a href="#tvalidator">validator</a> to test your spreadsheet is correct.

##Thumbnails

Thumbnails of your maps in size max. 1000 x 1000 px with the same ID as in the spreadsheet. Institutions using the Georeferencer service can skip this step.
