##About

**The search engine for historical maps**

OldMapsOnline allows users to search for online historical maps across numerous collections from prominent libraries and archives. It was developed with love to history and heritage of the old maps and thanks to all participants, the site lists over half a million historical maps.

Copyright
All copyright and IPR rights relating to the map images and metadata records are retained by the host institutions which provided them and any query regarding them must be addressed to that particular host institution. Host institutions provide their own Terms of Use. The project was created by a collaboration between Klokan Technologies GmbH, Switzerland and The University of Portsmouth, UK. 

Technology
The website is created by Klokan Technologies GmbH, specialized in online map publishing and applications of open-source software. The aim is to demonstrate a combination of tools for publishing historical maps with focus on easy accesibility by general public. If you wish to include these technologies for other purposes, such as National or European development projects, we can share our expertise and take a part.
