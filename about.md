##About

**Interested in maps? Visit the search interface.**

The OldMapsOnline Portal is an easy-to-use gateway to historical maps in libraries around the world.

It allows the user to search for online digital historical maps across numerous different collections via a geographical search. Search by typing a place-name or by clicking in the map window, and narrow by date. The search results provide a direct link to the map image on the website of the host institution.

OldMapsOnline has been created by a collaboration between The Great Britain Historical GIS Project based at The University of Portsmouth, UK and Klokan Technologies GmbH, Switzerland. 

Its creation was funded by Jisc under Strand C: Clustering Digital Content of their Content Programme 2011-13. It is the successor of a project lead by the Moravian Library in the Czech Republic between 2008 and 2011. The portal is based on the MapRank Search technology originally developed for the Kartenportal project in Switzerland.  

All copyright and IPR rights relating to the map images and metadata records are retained by the host institution which provided them and any query regarding them must be addressed to that particular host institution. Host institutions provide their own Terms of Use. Along with the links provided in the individual search results a general link to the maps section of the website of each host institution is also provided on our Collections page following each Collection description.

OldMapsOnline provides Terms of Use and Help guidelines, but not an enquiry service.
For all queries relating to the metadata or maps including purchasing copies please contact the host institution concerned.
For any queries relating to the search technology behind the interface please contact Klokan Technologies GmbH.

The Jisc funding ended on 31st January 2013. Site updates will still be made, but more intermittently in future. Queries should be directed to the project team: info@oldmapsonline.org
