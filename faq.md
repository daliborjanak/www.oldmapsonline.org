##About the website Old Maps Online

**How do I view the old maps?**

Go to the Search page. Type in a place-name in the search box or zoom/pan the map window. Thumbnail images and metadata information will appear in the right side bar showing the search results (this list will automatically update as you change the view in the map window). Click on the map record that interests you in the search results and you will see the full metadata information we hold for that map record. Click on the link in the metadata to go straight to view the old map.

**Who is Old Maps Online for?**

Anybody who is interested in old maps and what they can tell us about the past.

**What does Old Maps Online do?**

It combines the information about digital map images from a number of different libraries and other host institutions in a single search interface so you donâ€™t need to know where the map is kept in order to find it. It allows you to locate maps showing the same geographical area, but which are held by different institutions so you can more easily decide which is most relevant to you.

**Is Old Maps Online free to use?**

Yes. We offer users a free, open-access search portal without the need for download, registration or subscription.



##About the map images

**What kind of maps are in Old Maps Online?**

All the maps are historical. They cover a range of different scales, dates and include types such as land use, administrative, boundary, toponymic, political, military, town plans, estate maps and admiralty sea charts.

**Why are some maps not straight in my browser window?**

Maps are presented as they were originally published. Map makers in the past did not have access to the high-tech tools we use for accuracy today. The maps are located in the right place geographically so you can find them, but we do not try to distort them to fit modern mapping, instead presenting them as they were drawn.

**Are the digital map images under any copyright?**

Yes. Copyright for each map image is retained by the host institution supplying the image and it their conditions you should follow. Each map record clearly states within which host institution the map is held and provides a link to their catalogue. For more information about using an image please see the Terms of Use for individual host institutions. A General link to the map collection of each host institution is also available on our Collections page.

**Can I buy these maps?**

We do not supply copies of the maps because Old Maps Online is purely a portal for searching and accessing maps from different institutions in a single place. Each map record clearly states within which institution the map is held and provides a link their catalogue. You may be able to purchase paper or electronic copies of the maps from the host institution. Please see the relevant host institution website for more information, a general link is available on our Collections page.

*What date is the map visible in the search map window?**

This is a modern map provided purely as a search mechanism to help users identify locations they are interested in.

**Why does the map in the map window fade in and out as I move around it?**

The faded area identifies the co-ordinate search box. The small insert overview map shown at the bottom right gives an indication of the area covered by the co-ordinate search box in relation to the wider area.



##About the metadata

**What is metadata?**

It is information that describes the data. In Old Maps Online metadata records describe the maps.

**What metadata can I see?**

Each metadata map record contains a title, a date for the information shown on the map, and a URL link to directly access the map on the website of the host institution. There may also be additional publication information if it is available.

**Is the metadata under any copyright?**

Yes. Copyright for each metadata record is retained by the host institution supplying the record and it their conditions you should follow. Each map record clearly states within which host institution the map is held and provides a link their catalogue.
