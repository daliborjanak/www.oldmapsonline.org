#A unique mobile app from the heart of Switzerland

On Tuesday, July 21, Klokan Technologies GmbH with its head office in Unterägeri (Canton of
Zug) will launch its new version of a popular website OldMapsOnline.org together with its 
bright new mobile application that thanks to the device’s geolocation can display position of 
users on maps that might be even hundreds of years old. Thanks to this successful company 
from the field of online map publishing, the Canton of Zug could be described not only as a 
place with a beautiful landscape, tasty cherry cakes and friendly people, but also as a world’s 
capital of digital mapping search mechanisms.  

OldMapsOnline  is a search engine for maps in libraries that allows visitors to explore and 
discover the beauty of historical maps depicting a geographical place of their interest in the 
past. It is a well known project in the cultural heritage sector. From its first launch in 2012, the 
website has had over 1,100,000 visitors and it already indexes over 400,000 scanned maps from 
collections of The British Library, National Library of Scotland, David Rumsey, Harvard Library, 
Dutch National Archives, Charles University in Prague, New York Public Library, and other 
institutions worldwide. 

OldMapsOnline provides a single entry point for searching maps of the same geographical 
location without the need to know which library holds the actual map. This is a real benefit for 
researchers and students because it saves their time, effort and costs. 

The idea for the OldMapsOnline search engine was formed years back while its creator, Petr 
Pridal from Klokan Technologies GmbH, worked in a public library as a student intern. “As many 
other people I have been fascinated by the beauty of the historical maps ‐ and especially 
excited in using the power of modern computer technology to breathe new life into these 
archival documents and help them reach new audience,” says Pridal about his passion.  Thanks 
to funding from JISC he created OldMapsOnline in collaboration with The Great Britain Historical GIS 
Project based at The University of Portsmouth. He received a special award from the Royal Scottish 
Geographical Society and  experts from UK national libraries included Old Maps Online on a list of 100 
websites important enough to preserve for future generations.

OldMapsOnline uses the MapRank® search system to retrieve maps from a large database of 
online maps from various map collections of institutions all over the world. The new application 
provides an easy to use touch optimized interface that allows users to discover and explore the 
historical maps directly on mobile phones and tablets, while using the device geolocation.  
„OldMapsOnline is a fantastic website. The whole interface, the look and feel is really new, 
really modern and it provides a really interesting and engaging way for our collections to be 
exposed to a wider audience,“ describes Chris Fleet from the National Library of Scotland.

„There was no real online mapping search mechanism before,“ said Kimberly Kowal from the 
British Library at the conference in Edinburgh one year after the launch of the OldMapsOnline 
website. „It is the best single place to go to find historical maps online, “ Kowal continues. With 
the development of the mobile app it will be even easier to access historical maps and to 
undertake a virtual journey back in time anywhere.
