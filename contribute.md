#Contribute

*We want to provide access to as many map collections as possible from Old Maps Online, just so long as they meet these requirements:*

**1. High resolution scans of old maps (300 DPI, or at least 2 Mpix)**
**2. Maps in a zoomable viewer, available online without payments or passwords**
**3. Each map has its own permanent URL, taking users directly to the viewer**
**4. You have coordinates for the corners of each map**

To upload your maps to OldMapsOnline, we need to receive:


##Spreadsheet with the list of maps

To add a map collection we need a excel spreadsheet with basic information about each map.

DOWNLOAD A SAMPLE

Each spreadsheet must have following columns:

id: Your unique identifier
viewer: URL to the zoomable viewer of the scan on the web 
title: Title of the map
date_from, date_to: Date of what is depicted on the map, not the publishing date;
if you know the exact date, then in either YYYY, YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD format
if you know only the century, then as YYXX; eg. 16XX for the 1600-1699
north: Latitude of the north-most point
south: Latitude of the south-most point
east: Longitude of the east-most point
west: Longitude of the west-most point

Use validator to test your spreadsheet is correct.

##Thumbnails

Thumbnails of your maps in size max. 1000 x 1000 px with the same ID as in the spreadsheet. Institutions using the Georeferencer service can skip this step.

Once your spreadsheet and thumbnails are ready, please contact us at info@oldmapsonline.org
