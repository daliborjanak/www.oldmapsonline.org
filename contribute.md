#Contribute

*We want to provide access to as many map collections as possible from Old Maps Online, just so long as they meet these requirements:*

**1. You have high resolution scans of old maps**

Old Maps Online is about digital images, not paper maps, and each image must have a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch, or consist of at least 2 megapixels. File formats don't matter, as we won't be hosting the images.

**2. Your maps are directly viewable online, without payments or passwords**

We aim to create a global virtual map library for everyone. Most people want simply to see maps so you must provide an online viewer. You may or may not have a download facility, and that may or may not involve payments or passwords -- in general, we don't care, but if you are a commercial company and the main purpose of your site is to sell downloads or paper copies, we would expect to have an affiliate relationship with you.

**3. Each map has its own permanent URL, taking users to a viewer**

Permanent means that the URL will work fairly reliably for the next five or six years. If your URLs are long and complex, tied to particular server technologies, or concealed from users by your server set-up, we are interested in helping enhance them to make individual maps more easily citable. We will take users straight to your individual map pages, so you may want to ensure users can then navigate out to the rest of your site.

**4. You have real-world coordinates for the corners of each map**

The maps do not need to be especially accurate -- old maps usually aren't -- and we certainly don't require you to be using special GIS-based software for showing them to users. However, Old Maps Online obviously depends on having coordinates, maybe approximate, for each corner. See below for how we can help you create them.

##Contacting us to contribute

If you think your collection meets these requirements, email us at info@oldmapsonline.org

Inclusion in Old Maps Online is completely free for non-commercial sites based anywhere in the world, and while our funding lasts -- until January 2013, at least -- we will work to assist you.

You do not need to provide images, but we do need you to supply your metadata in a suitable format, preferably an Excel spreadsheet:

- Your internal **unique identifier** for each map
- The **map title**, and optionally other publication details
- The **date** of the information shown on the map (a separate date of publication is optional)
- The **coordinates** of the four corners, the scale of the map, and the coordinate system you use (we can handle coordinate conversion)
- A **URL** at which the map can be accessed in your viewer

We will ask you to sign a publishing agreement with the University of Portsmouth, so we can display the metadata in the portal, but you retain ownership of the copyright in your metadata.

##Adding real world coordinates

Many map collections have been scanned and can be viewed online, but lack the geographical coordinate data that Old Maps Online needs to provide access. There are many ways to create these coordinates, but we recommend Klokan Technologies' Georeferencer software, which does not require staff training and enables online library users to do the geo-referencing.

We have been able to include British Library maps in the first release of Old Maps Online only because of the rapid success of their crowd-sourcing project using Georeferencer with over 700 maps. This was expected to take months, but was completed in just one week. For more details of the British Library project see:
