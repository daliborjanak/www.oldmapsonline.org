<h1>Collections</h1>

<p>Below are brief descriptions of the online digital map collections searchable and accessible through the 
OldMapsOnline portal. Nearly all the institutions providing online map collections have a much larger paper 
map collection available at their respective institutions, but the OldMapsOnline portal will only search 
and provide direct linkage to the online maps.</p>

<p>Since 2012, OldMapsOnline.org indexes over half a million maps. This is only thanks to the archives and libraries, that were opened to the idea and provided their online content. All new participants are therefore warmly welcomed.
