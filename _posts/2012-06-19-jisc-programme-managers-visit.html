As this was his first trip to see us he spent the time meeting the team here (Humphrey, Paula and John) and talking about the project. Topics discussed covered progress so far, plans for the remainder of the project, our outstanding issues, mostly concerned with copyright, and how he might be able to facilitate a resolution to these issues.<br /><br />After lunch he was pleased to see work in progress, including a world map showing plotted corner points of digitised maps from a new set of metadata which is currently being edited for inclusion in the portal.
