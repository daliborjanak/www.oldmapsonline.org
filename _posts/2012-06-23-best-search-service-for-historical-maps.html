<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">On June 15th, Old Maps Online was presented at the Europeana Plenary meeting in Belgium. Europeana is the European digital library hub. More details of the meeting <a href="http://kadmeianletters.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/my-europeana-plenary-part-ii-the-product-development-session-and-hack4europe" target="_blank">here</a>, but we have to quote this bit:<br /><blockquote>Second up was Petr Pridal who spoke about Old Maps Online, the technology it builds on and how this map project took help from the public in getting 1000 maps geo-referenced in a couple of days. I invited Petr because Old Maps Online is the best search service for historical maps yet built. And also because he combines entrepeneurial spirit with technical insight in a way that I think is sorely needed among GLAMs.</blockquote>This bit about "getting 1000 maps geo-referenced in a couple of days" is of course mainly about the separate British Library project. Petr's presentation is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/klokan/leuven-europeana-plenary-2012-old-maps-online" target="_blank">here</a>. <br /><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VUQEci34PMU/T-nApcnzezI/AAAAAAAANk4/w9UYwmIa__w/s1600/europeana-leuven-2012.png" /></div></div></div>
