The British Library's project to work with its users to geo-reference historical maps, announced her in an earlier posting, was expected to take some months but completed its work in under a week. This has enabled us to include over seven hundred maps from the original Ordnance Surveyors' drawings and from the Crace Collection in the first version of Old Maps Online.<br /><br />The project used Klokan Technology's cloud-hosted Georeference software, and we would be very interested in discussing its use with other libraries who hold substantial numbers of scanned maps that lack geo-referencing. This is certainly not the only way to create the geo-referencing needed to add maps to Old Maps Online, but avoids both the need for manual geo-referencing by specialists and libraries having to set up specialised software.<br /><br />The British Library are planning a second round of geo-referencing, with a further 1,000 maps, and we look forward to adding them to Old Maps Online.
