We have just been informed that our proposal has been accepted by the programme committee.<br /><br />The emphasis of the ELAG conference is on new developments and practical experience with library technology, but workshops make ELAG different from most conferences. They are taking place during the first two days in between plenary sessions while on the last day, each workshop will present its results in a plenary meeting.<br /><br />We look forward to see you and to discuss our project and related topics!
