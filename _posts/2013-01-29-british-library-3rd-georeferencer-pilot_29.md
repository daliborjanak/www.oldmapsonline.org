Using <a href="http://www.klokantech.com/georeferencer/" target="_blank">Georeferencer</a> software from <b>Klokan technologies</b>, another 800 items have been selected for the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/maps/"><span class="s2">Georeferencer Project</span></a> from the British Library’s collection of over 4.5 million maps. The last time the British Library undertook such a project 708 maps were completed in less than one week.

<b>”It’s easy to use and highly addictive – and a fascinating way to explore the past while improving the information that underpins our digitised collections. This project brings together people’s passion for maps and history with the latest online crowdsourcing tools,”</b>
says Kimberly Kowal, Lead Curator of Digital Mapping at the British Library.

As a result of these previous successful rounds of public crowdsourcing, those maps are now spatially enabled, allowing users to search and navigate maps online. Maps from previous rounds are accessible through the Library’s <a href="http://www.oldmapsonline.org/"><span class="s2">Old Maps Online</span></a> portal developed by <b>Klokan Technologies.</b>
