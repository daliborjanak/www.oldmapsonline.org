<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"> <img border="0" src="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/media/OpenLayers_logo.png" /> This week Petr is one of seven people working together on a major new version of OpenLayers envisioned as having two options, one for img/SVG/VML/Canvas files and another for WebGL (Canvas 3D) which would allow client side editing and being able to see things in perspective. They are discussing architecture, the library and a new API.<br /><br />For more details of the discussions take a look at the <a href="http://openlayers.org/blog/2012/06/21/ol3-sprint/" target="_blank">project blog</a>, whilst progress will be reported here: <a href="https://github.com/openlayers/ol3" target="_blank">https://github.com/openlayers/ol3</a></div>
