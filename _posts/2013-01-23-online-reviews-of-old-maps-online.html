<br />After nearly a whole year of Old Maps Online being live we thought we'd do a quick review of blog comments mentioning the site which have been posted since the initial flurry of interest following the launch. Below are a selection of what we found people have said about actually using the site.<div><br />1st March 2012, <a href="http://brownhillsbob.com/2012/03/01/one-for-the-old-map-addicts/">Brownhillsbob's Brownhills Blog</a><br />"Here’s a great one... It’s a new site for old maps – it’s got lots of great material, including Ordnance Survey popular and inter-war editions, and the resolution and working area are great too, often a bit of a limitation on such services. Best of all, it’s absolutely free of charge to use."<br /><br />30th March 2012, <a href="http://www.latestwebcrunch.com/the-3-best-places-to-find-free-historical-maps-online">Latest Web Crunch</a><br />"The 3 Best Places To Find Free Historical Maps Online: [1] Old Maps Online.
