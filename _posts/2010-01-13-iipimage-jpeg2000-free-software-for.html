<a href="http://www.mzk.cz/">Moravian Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.oldmapsonline.org/">OldMapsOnline.org</a> project are proud to announce the release of a new version of the open-source IIPImage server software (<a href="http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000/">http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000/</a>).<br /><br /><img src="/blog/media/jpeg2000.png" alt="">The freely available IIPImage software can be used for stunning online presentations of scanned documents, paintings, maps, books, newspapers, photographs or other high-resolution images on the web directly from JPEG2000 or TIFF files.<br /><br />The new version allows direct publishing from JPEG2000 images to a wide variety of different client technologies based on AJAX, Adobe Flash or Silverlight. These include popular pan&zoom viewers based on Zoomify or Seadragon technology (including the Seadragon AJAX viewer and the Seadragon iPhone application) as well as it's own AJAX enabled IIPMooViewer. The documents provided by IIPImage can be displayed in any web browser and on a number of platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux or iPhone.<br /><br /><a href="http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000"><img src="/blog/media/mooviewer.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The software is primarily targeted at institutions who operate their own server connected to the Internet and who want to publish large collections of digital images directly from JPEG2000 or<br />TIFF files.<br /><br />Institutions who does not have the necessary infrastructure can follow our alternative tutorial at <a href="http://help.oldmapsonline.org/publish/">http://help.oldmapsonline.org/publish/</a> on how to achieve the same using standard web hosting and free software.<br /><br /><img src="/blog/media/iphoneiipimage.jpg" border="0" alt="" />IIPImage is a light-weight client-server system for fast and efficient online viewing and zooming of ultra high-resolution images. It is designed to be bandwidth and memory efficient and usable over a slow Internet connection even on gigapixel sized images.<br />It is available for free, under an open source license (GNU GPL). We recommend installing<br />the software on a Linux (or other UNIX) server. We have prepared an easy to install binary package for Debian and Ubuntu with step-by-step instructions for installation.<br /><br />JPEG2000 support has been implemented using the Kakadu library, which provides one of the fastest implementations of the JPEG2000 ISO standard and is redistributable for non-commercial use.<br /><br />The enhancement of IIPImage was developed by the Moravian Library and the OldMapsOnline.org project with the support of grants from the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic.<br /><br />The Moravian Library (<a href="http://www.mzk.cz/">http://www.mzk.cz/</a>), based in Brno, Czech Republic, is a research institution and a legal deposit library. Project OldMapsOnline.org (<a href="http://www.oldmapsonline.org/">http://www.oldmapsonline.org/</a>) is a research project of the Moravian Library that aims to develop software to assist in the management, manipulation and visualisation of historical map collections on the web. The project team is designing online tools for publishing, collaborative georeferencing, annotation, 3D visualisation, accuracy analysis and geometadata specification for old maps.<br /><br />For more information and for the IIPImage JPEG2000 software, see <a href="http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000/">http://help.oldmapsonline.org/jpeg2000/</a>.
