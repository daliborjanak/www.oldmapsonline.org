In these days you have the unique opportunity to get involved and help the British Library to georeference new digitized maps, which were selected for scanning and online publishing recently.

Nearly 2800 maps are now available online and waiting for georeferencing. It is really easy process.

See this video:

and start at:  <a href="http://www.bl.uk/maps/">http://www.bl.uk/maps/</a>
This release has implemented new functionality for use within social media, including better personalisation and visualisation options. It is possible to compare two old maps and create a personal map collection with the new "My Maps" function.

Klokan Technologies also prepared new Facebook application for georeferencing maps from the BL, you can participate and in the same moment compete with your FB friends:  <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/georeferencer/">https://apps.facebook.com/georeferencer/</a>﻿

Moreover, involved contributors can choose from two different collections of maps, which were selected for release:

First collection represents maps of <b>British and Irish towns and its fire insurance plans (2500 maps)</b>. This collection provides information, which you will not find somewhere else, not just about the land use, buildings, but also about the urban landscape in the late 19thc - 20th century.


Second collection consists of military maps from the <b>World War I and US Civic War (225 maps)</b>. Among these maps you can find trench maps, campaign charts and also ethnographic mapping.

Each contributor will see his/her details and the best contributor will be publicly announced.
