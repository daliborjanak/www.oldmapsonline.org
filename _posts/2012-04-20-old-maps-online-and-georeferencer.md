title: Old Maps Online and Georeferencer presented on a Conference in Barcelona
---

Barcelona played host to <b>librarians and researchers from 24 different countries</b> as they met to  present their results and ongoing projects working with <b>old maps</b>.

<b>Petr Pridal</b> from <b>Klokan Technologies</b> was on a place and shared his ideas with other colleagues from a research field. Old Maps Online project and Georeferencer were presented. We believe that such meetings move the field of research based upon Old maps step by step to greater future and have enjoyed being present on this event.

There were two joined conferences which had very exciting programmes, both are available online:
