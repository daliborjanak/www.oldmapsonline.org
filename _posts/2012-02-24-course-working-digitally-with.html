The Great Britain Historical GIS Team and the University of Portsmouth are running a one-week hands-on introduction to historical GIS methods on June 18th-22nd, 2012. <br /><br />It  is aimed at anyone wanting to create a digital resource from sources  which are both historical and geographical – most obviously old maps,  but also historical census information or geographically rich text. You  may be planning on building a “historical GIS” or simply a web site with  many maps – one aim is to help you decide the most appropriate final  result for your particular sources and goals:<br /><br /> <img alt="" height="200" src="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/media/portsmouth_1stser1.gif" title="Portsmouth 1st ser" width="200" /><ul><li>We will equip you to do a small project in historical GIS or  map-based digitization; or to plan and manage a larger project – so we  include both hands-on training with GIS software, and sessions on source  selection, project planning, copyright and budgeting.</li><li>Hands-on training emphasizes <a href="http://www.qgis.org/" target="_blank" title="Quantum GIS">Quantum GIS</a>,  a capable free open-source alternative to the commercial GIS software  that historians and ‘memory institutions’ cannot afford, but most skills  will be transferable to other programs.</li><li>Quantum excels in accessing standards-based on-line GIS services,  such as web map servers providing base maps. We will show you how to  avoid starting from scratch, by accessing new online services and  download facilities within the GB Historical GIS.</li><li>Members of the GB Historical GIS team will teach core modules, but  the course also features case studies presented by other members of  Portsmouth Geography, and speakers from the Ordnance Survey, British  Library and the National Archives.</li><li>Hands-on sessions will have a maximum of ten attendees per leader. </li><li>Our campus adjoins Portsmouth’s historic dockyard, home of the Royal  Navy for five hundred years. The course includes a visit to the  Admiralty Map Library, one of the world’s great historical map libraries  but open to visitors only by special arrangement, and a dinner at the  Royal Naval Club.</li><li>Portsmouth is an hour and a half from London by train, and easily  reached from London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Southampton airports.  Car parking can be arranged.</li></ul>Portsmouth Geography is the base for the Great Britain Historical GIS  project and several other major online resources. Uniquely, we have not  just twenty years experience in historical GIS, but over ten years of  experience in employing Geographical Information Systems technology in  standards-based digitization projects, with funding from the UK National  Lottery, the Joint Information Systems Committee and the European  Union.<br /><br />Course fee: £849, including lunches, refreshments and the Working Digitally dinner. Overnight accommodation for four to six nights is available for £37.50 per night (bed and breakfast).
