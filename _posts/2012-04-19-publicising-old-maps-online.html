Since the launch review post published a month ago, we have been continuing to demonstrate and publicise the existence of the website to a variety of audiences at every opportunity. On Thursday 22nd March Humphrey and Paula ran a session specifically about Old Maps Online at the <a href="http://www.ukad.org/forum2012/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK Archives Discovery Forum 2012</a> held at The National Archives in Kew, London. The session was popular and those attending were very interested and complimentary about the website. Kimberly Kowal from the project's steering group also presented on the British Library's crowd sourcing project. This day was aimed at archivists involved in promoting working together to open up data access.

The conference attracts a large number of scholars interested in explaining historical phenomena using social science methodologies. 
<br /><br />This week Humphrey and Petr will both be in Barcelona to present papers on the project at two events. Firstly at 
the 18th Conference of the LIBER Groupe des Cartoth√©caires - Maps Expert Group 
<a href="http://www.icc.cat/eng/Home-ICC/Home/Map-Library/Catalogue-consulting/The-Map-Library/Services/LIBER-GdC/Programme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">'Map libraries in a changing world'</a> on the 17-18th April. Humphrey will present '<i>Embedding historical maps in the practices of historical GIS and Geosemantics: From URLs to URls' </i>whilst a member of the project steering group, Christopher Fleet from the National Library of Scotland, will present with Petr on '<i>Open source technologies for delivering historical maps online - case studies at the National Library of Scotland'.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />For the remainder of this week, Humphrey and Petr will attend the 7th International ICA workshop <a href="http://xeee.web.auth.gr/ICA-Heritage/2011_2015/BARCELONA_2012/Barcelona_Sessions.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><i>'</i>Digital Approaches to Cartographic Heritage'</a> where they will jointly present <i>'Old Maps Online: Enabling global access to historical mapping' </i>during the first 'Map Libraries, Collections, Archives' session. During the second of these sessions Humphrey will act as co-chair and Petr will present a paper with Christopher Fleet on <i>'Opening historical maps for community mash-ups - a case study of the NLS Historical Maps API '</i>. Petr will also present with Kimberly Kowal on <i>'Improvements to crowdsourced georeferencing using Georeferencer, and its implementation at the British Library'</i> during the 'Georeferencing, Map Content' session and he will chair the session entitled 'Map Content, Territories, Urban cases'.
