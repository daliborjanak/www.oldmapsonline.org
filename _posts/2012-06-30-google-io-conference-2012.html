June 27th-29th 2012 saw the Google I/O conference take place in the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Following on from the potal's appearance on the 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/showcase/" target="_blank">Google Developers showcase</a> 
listing of sites they like (as we reported in May), the Old Maps Online team were invited to present the portal at this event.
<br /><br />The conference which is organised by Google to highlight new innovations and products to developers will show 
the portal on slides as an example of best practice with styled maps. Vaclav Klusak of Klokan Technologies GmbH represented the project at this prestigious event.
