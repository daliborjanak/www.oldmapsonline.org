title: Georeferencer for State Library New South Wales
---

Glad to see another Georeferencer project for State Library New South Wales in
Australia. The tricky part of this project were significant changes in names of
the streets, which needed the contributors with local knowledge.

Over 900 maps were successfully placed and the obtained data enriched the library
catalogue with geographical locations. More information about the project is
available atÂ <a href="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/using/map_georeferencing.html">
