As part of the Jisc funding requirements the Old Maps Online team had to produce 
a video report on the impacts of the website. As the site launched early on in the 
life of the project there was plenty of material for inclusion in the video and lots 
of people willing to talk about why they like the site.

<br><br>
The filming was done on location at the one-day conference,&nbsp;<i>Working 
Digitally with Historical Maps,</i>  that we organised in Edinburgh 
in December 2013 and we are grateful to the National Library of Scotland 
for allowing this.
