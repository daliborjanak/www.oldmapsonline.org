As the site launched early on in the life of the project there was plenty of material for inclusion in the video and lots of people willing to talk about why they like the site.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The filming was done on location at the one-day conference,&nbsp;<i>Working Digitally with Historical Maps,</i>  that we organised in Edinburgh in December 2013 and we are grateful to the National Library of Scotland for allowing this. The video has been uploaded onto and is available to view on the new <a href="http://project.oldmapsonline.org/impacts" target="_blank">"Impacts"</a> page on the website</span>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
