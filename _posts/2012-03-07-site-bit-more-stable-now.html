It is just after 4 on Wednesday afternoon in the UK, and the site seems to have been running fairly reliably for the last couple of hours, after a bumpy time this morning. We are currently handling around 1,700 simultaneous users, and both servers are reasonably happy.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if this level of interest is sustained.
