Most recent blog posts have been about our dissemination activities, but there is still plenty going on behind the scenes as well. The bi-annual Progress Report was due to JISC this week and we are ahead of schedule having already written and submitted this.<br /><br />This week will see the second team meeting here in Portsmouth when we will be discussing where we stand on existing and planned content, how we might refine and improve the website and the plans for the site after the funding finishes next January. Towards the end of the week we will also hold our second Steering Group meeting and all the papers have been prepared for that. <br /><br />As hinted in the previous post we have been working hard on adding new collections to the system and will be announcing the extra content imminently so keep an eye out.
