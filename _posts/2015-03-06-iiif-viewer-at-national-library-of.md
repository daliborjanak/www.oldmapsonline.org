We are glad to see our IIIF Viewer applied on various websites. IIIF Viewer is
an Open-Source component brought by Klokan Technologies. IIIFViewer is optimized
for desktop and mobile devices (iOS, Android), is open-source, free to use and has,
compared to other viewers, the following extra features:

- Rotation on client side: pinch with fingers, alt-shift drag with the mouse.
- Drawing tools: polygons, lines, markers â€” can be used to annotate parts of the pictures.
- Color adjustment: saturation, lightness, etc.The source
