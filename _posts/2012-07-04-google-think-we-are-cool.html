<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last week Vaclav Klusak from our team attended the Google  I/O Conference in San Francisco, and was able to demonstrate Old Maps  Online there.<br /><br />Even better, two members of the Google Maps engineering team  used Old Maps Online as their first  non-in-house example of how best to  use the optional styling facilities in the Google Maps API to suit a  particular site. Jonah Jones, the design lead for Google Maps, said:<br /><blockquote>Old  Maps Online let you find historical maps in libraries around the world,  and they have got a map that really feels historical and old. They have  got a faded color palate, they have got this cool kind of grain effect  that you see over the top.</blockquote>You can see their presentation online, and he makes this comment a minute in:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/gooio2012/901" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/gooio2012/901</a></div><br />However, you can't please everybody. One user recently mailed us to say:<br /><blockquote>All  I am getting is a very faint background with faint outlines of a main  road and a river. What am I not doing/doing wrong? ... I know it’s free  but I’ve accessed many other free sites and this is the most frustrating  website I have ever had the misfortune to come across.</blockquote>Looks  like he is unhappy about exactly the styling the Google Maps team think  is cool! We do wonder if he needs to adjust his display.<br /><br />This blog has been getting visually rather boring, so from now on we will try to include maps of the places we do presentations. Here, for example, is part of a 1908 maps in the David Rumsey collection showing the relative intensity of the San Francisco earthquake. The full map is <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?q=List_No=2130.019&amp;showFirstDetail=1" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R21FD-x0rt4/T_Rar21aPLI/AAAAAAAAACM/us2EKIenZBA/s1600/San%2BFrancisco%2Bearthquake%2Bmap.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5761329532814113970" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R21FD-x0rt4/T_Rar21aPLI/AAAAAAAAACM/us2EKIenZBA/s320/San%2BFrancisco%2Bearthquake%2Bmap.png" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 198px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 320px;" /></a></div>
