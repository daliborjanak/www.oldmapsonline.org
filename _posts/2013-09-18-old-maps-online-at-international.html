Despite the funding from Jisc finishing in January this year we are still working to promote the project. Petr Přidal of Klokan Technologies recently presented a poster at the International Cartographic Conference, which this year was held in Dresden, Germany from the 25th -30th August. The poster presentation focused on the Old Maps Online project as a search system tailored to work with historical maps in a spatial way, something traditional search engines struggle with, and how implementing Georeferencer as a means to turn scanned maps into digital resources which are easy to find using crowd-sourcing helped various national libraries contribute their maps to the Old Maps Online system. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k0AUWIh_IZE/UjlqeD8Kz2I/AAAAAAAAADk/fQcNN-PkaBE/s1600/dresden-icc2013-poster.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k0AUWIh_IZE/UjlqeD8Kz2I/AAAAAAAAADk/fQcNN-PkaBE/s640/dresden-icc2013-poster.jpg" title="Dresden poster" width="448" /></a></div><br />
